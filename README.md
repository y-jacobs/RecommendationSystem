# RecommendationSystem

This project implements user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to generate movie recommendations. The system builds similarity matrices based on user or item preferences using cosine similarity, then predicts movie ratings for users. The model can handle unseen users (cold-start problem) by inserting a "fake" user into the dataset. The project supports top-k nearest neighbors filtering to refine recommendations. Evaluation functions allow for testing recommendation accuracy on various datasets.
